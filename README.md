![jocoNLP Logo](static/jocoNLP.svg)

## Overview

This is an interactive Natural Language Processing (NLP) portfolio built with Streamlit, showcasing various NLP techniques and models. The application provides hands-on demonstrations of different NLP concepts, from basic text processing to advanced transformer models.

## Features

- **Interactive Demos**: Try out different NLP techniques in real-time
- **Educational Content**: Learn about various NLP concepts with detailed explanations
- **Code Examples**: View implementation examples for each technique
- **Visual Results**: See visual representations of NLP processes

### Featured NLP Techniques

1. **Tokenization**
   - Text segmentation into meaningful units
   - Multiple tokenization approaches
   - Interactive text analysis

2. **Word Embeddings**
   - Word2Vec implementations
   - GloVe embeddings
   - Semantic word representations

3. **Transformer Models**
   - BERT integration
   - GPT model implementations
   - State-of-the-art language understanding

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language
- **Streamlit**: Web application framework
- **spaCy**: Industrial-strength NLP
- **Hugging Face Transformers**: State-of-the-art models
- **NLTK**: Natural Language Toolkit
